# MS Control Plane

This repository is designed to manage the deployments of microservices using Helm Charts. It provides configurations and default values to simplify the deployment and management of microservices in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Repository Structure

- **`values.yaml`**: Contains the default values for the Helm Charts.
- **`.gitignore`**: Defines the files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- **`templates/`**: Folder where Kubernetes templates generated by Helm are stored.
- **`values/<environment>/`**: Directory where individual microservice configuration files are stored.

## Requirements

- Helm 3.x or higher.
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Adding a Microservice

To add a new microservice:

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd ms-control-plane
    ```

2. Create a file named `<microservice-name>.yml` in the directory `values/<environment>/`.
3. Define the specific configuration for the microservice in this file.

    For example:
    ```yaml
    replicaCount: 2
    image:
    repository: my-microservice
    tag: "1.0.0"
    service:
    type: ClusterIP
    port: 8080
    ```

4. Deploy the microservices using Helm:
    ```bash
    helm install <release-name> . -f values/<environment>/<microservice-name>.yml
    ```
